# PyReason-Ops ⚙️🤖
Rule-based reasoning engine for AI-driven operations (AIOps).

## 📘 Overview
This PoC investigates symbolic reasoning for automated cloud decisions.
It demonstrates how formal logic rules can supplement machine learning
models to improve transparency and reliability.

Developed as preliminary work for the University of Manchester MPhil project:
**"Towards Explainable and Reliable AI-Driven Operations"**

## ⚙️ Structure
- `/rules/` - logic or constraint files
- `/src/` - reasoning engine implementation

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Integrate with simple telemetry inputs.
2. Extend to constraint satisfaction using `z3-solver`.
3. Evaluate decision correctness vs. baseline heuristics.
